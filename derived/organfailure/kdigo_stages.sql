-- Purpose:
-- - This code is designed to classify AKI stage using creatinine and urine output according to
--   KDIGO AKI guidelines. This query checks if the patient had AKI according to KDIGO. AKI is
--   calculated every time a creatinine or urine output measurement occurs. Baseline creatinine is
--   defined as the lowest creatinine in the past or post 7 days.
-- Reference:
-- - https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/blob/main/mimic-iv/concepts/organfailure/kdigo_stages.sql
-- - https://kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/KDIGO-2012-AKI-Guideline-English.pdf
-- History:
-- - 1.0: Create new query.
-- - 3.0 [2024-05-05]:
--   - Add both eICU and MIMIC style keys.
--   - Modify RRT part.
--   - Reset version number across all queries and databases.
